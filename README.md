This is The Odin Project's google homepage exercise. It is about building the homepage of google using html & css. It is not a functional webpalge.

This project allowed me to work with and understand how to center images, elements inside of div tags or search bars.
Doing so I was able to effectively find the root problem of the issue, properly find the solution and implement it as well.
